I am a Python Full Stack Engineer specializing in building robust and scalable web applications. My expertise lies in developing high-performance backend systems using Python frameworks like Django and FastAPI, complemented by modern frontend technologies.

My professional focus includes:

- Building RESTful APIs and microservices with FastAPI and Django REST framework
- Developing full-stack web applications with Django
- Database design and optimization with PostgreSQL
- API integration and system architecture
- Cloud deployment and DevOps practices

I'm passionate about creating efficient, maintainable solutions that solve real-world problems. While I have experience with various technologies including React and Next.js, my primary expertise and focus is on Python-based development.

Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions about Python development, backend architecture, or software engineering in general.
